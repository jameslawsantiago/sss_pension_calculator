# 🧮 SSS Pension Computation

If a member is qualified, the amount of monthly pension will be the
**highest result** of the following formulas:

**A.** `₱300 + (20% × AMSC) + (2% × AMSC × (CYS – 10))`\
**B.** `40% × AMSC`\
**C.** Minimum pension:
- ₱1,200 if with at least **10 CYS**
- ₱2,400 if with at least **20 CYS**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📘 Key Terms

-   **MSC (Monthly Salary Credit):** Basis for computing contributions
    and pension.
-   **AMSC (Average Monthly Salary Credit):** Average of a member's MSC
    over their years of contributions.
-   **CYS (Credited Years of Service):** Total number of years a member
    has made contributions to SSS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📝 How to Compute AMSC

The **AMSC** is computed as follows:

-   **Formula:**

    -   Divide the **sum of the last 60 MSCs** immediately preceding the
        semester of contingency by 60,
    -   **OR** divide the sum of all MSCs paid prior to the semester of
        contingency by the total number of contributions paid in the
        same period.
    -   Use **whichever is higher**.

-   **Example:**\
    If your MSC is ₱20,000:

        20,000 × 60 = 1,200,000
        1,200,000 ÷ 60 = ₱20,000 AMSC

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📆 How to Compute CYS

Your **CYS** is the number of years you've contributed to SSS, including
creditable years (e.g., under the Employees' Compensation Program).

-   You can:
    -   Count contributions manually from your records, or\
    -   Use the **online calculator** provided by SSS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎁 Additional Benefit Allowance

An **additional ₱1,000 monthly benefit** is granted to all retirement,
death, and disability pensioners receiving monthly pensions **on or
after January 2017** (per Memorandum from the Executive Secretary dated
22 February 2017).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💡 Maximizing Your Pension

Your pension is computed based on:

-   Your **salary for the last 5 years before retirement**, or
-   If voluntary, the **contributions for the 60 months** before the
    semester of retirement.

👉 To **maximize your pension**, increase your contributions during the
last **5 years before retirement**.
